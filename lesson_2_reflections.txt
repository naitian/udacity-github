What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
    A .git hidden directory gets created, and that initializes the directory as a git repository.
    Otherwise, git wouldn't recognize the directory as a git repo.
How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you 
think it offers?
    A staging area is a middle ground between the working directory that can change at any time and
    the repository, which is separated into commits (not actually, just my way of thinking about
    it). It allows commits to bundle more than one file into one single commit.
