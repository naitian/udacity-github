How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was 
introduced?
	It helped to find exactly where changes and the introduction of the bugs were.
How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient 
programmer in the long term?
	I can see where I made possibly breaking changes to my code over time.
Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in 
one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?
	Some use cases donâ€™t need to be saved together because they are unrelated. 
	However, some use cases have interrelated files that need to be saved together.
How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?
	Use git log to find the commits that you want to view, and then use diff to find 
	the differences in those commits.
How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break 
something?
	I have the knowledge that I can always revert back to an earlier version.
Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?
	I want to use Git to manage my own projects as well as projects with a team.
