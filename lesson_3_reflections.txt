When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work locally?
  When collaborating with others.
Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-
date with your remote repository?
    So what you are working on won't be messed up by someone else's work.
Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of
another?
    Forks are between GitHub repos, clones are from GH to local, and branches are parts of the same 
    repo.
What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
    I can work offline.
